# International-Food-Security-Dashboard
The Dashboard has been created in Tableau using the International Food Security dataset.

# Data Source

This dataset is the basis for the International Food Security Assessment, 2016-2026 released in June 2016. This annual ERS report projects food availability and access for 76 low- and middle-income countries over a 10-year period. The dataset includes annual country-level data on area, yield, production, nonfood use, trade, and consumption for grains and root and tuber crops (combined as R&T in the documentation tables), food aid, total value of imports and exports, gross domestic product, and population compiled from a variety of sources.
